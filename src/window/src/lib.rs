//! Window storage and interfacing traits.
//!
//! The [`Window`](./trait.Window.html) trait is the minimum interface required for event loop.
//! All backends usually support this trait.
//!
//! The [`AdvancedWindow`](./trait.AdvancedWindow.html) trait
//! is the maximum interface that can be provided,
//! while still staying consistent between backends. Not all backends implement
//! `AdvancedWindow`; check your backend's documentation to see whether it implements
//! this trait.
//!
//! The [`WindowSettings`](./struct.WindowSettings.html) structure is the preferred way of building
//! new windows in Piston. It uses the `BuildFromWindowSettings` trait,
//! which backends implement to handle window creation and setup.
//!
//! The [`OpenGLWindow`](./trait.OpenGLWindow.html) trait is used to provide low-level
//! access to OpenGL through the abstract Piston API.
//!
//! The [`Size`](./struct.Size.html) structure is used throughout Piston to store window sizes.
//! It implements some conversion traits for convenience.
